# SIR-model
Simple exercise to learn how to use Flask. 
It takes as input three values (the dimension of the population, the initial number of infected people, and the R0 index - that has to be integer) and plots the number of susceptibles,
infected and recovered over time for a deterministic compartmental SIR model.
